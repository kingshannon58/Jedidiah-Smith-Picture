<p>The woods are ancient, dating back to 1929</p>
<h1>In 1929, the grove was donated to Save the Redwoods League, which were the main supporters behind the preservation of the trees</h1>
<p>Centuries of old trees rising above soft, luscious, carpet of ferns.</p> 
<h2>The donation was received from Clara Stout</h2>
<p>She made the donation in honor of her late husband, Frank Stout</p>
<h3>If you look on the ground of these forests, you are bound to see banana slugs</h3>
<p>The creatures can be spotted around the base of the redwood trees</p>
<h4>Near the forest, there is Jedediah Smith Campgrounds.</h4>
<p>Campers gain about a mile of hiking through redwoods</p>
